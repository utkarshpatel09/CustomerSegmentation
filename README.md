# 🧠 Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment retail customers based on their behavior and spending patterns. 
Leveraging the K-Means algorithm, we identify distinct customer groups to enable targeted marketing and personalization strategies.

## 🗂️ Dataset
Synthetic retail transaction dataset containing:
- `CustomerID`: Unique customer identifier
- `Annual_Spend`: Total yearly spending in currency units
- `Visit_Frequency`: Number of store visits per year
- `Product_Variety`: Count of unique product categories purchased

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy for data handling
- Scikit-learn for clustering
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

## 📊 Methodology
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Optimal cluster selection via Elbow Method and Silhouette Score
- K-Means clustering for customer segmentation
- Cluster visualization and interpretation

## 🔍 Insights
- Identified **4 distinct customer segments** based on spending and shopping habits
- Defined personas such as _Loyal High-Spenders_, _Occasional Bargain Seekers_, and more
- Provided actionable insights for personalized marketing

## 📈 Visuals
Cluster plots and feature distributions are available under the `/results` folder for easy interpretation.
